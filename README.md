# Valuation-of-an-IPO
Valuation of an IPO(Equity Valuation)
Abstract- In this project, we have to calculate the initial share price of a company going for IPO using its previous year's Balance Sheet and Income Statement.

I have selected an Indian manufacturing company to valuing its IPO and that is Varroc Engineering. Then I have downloaded it last five years(2014â€“2018) of Balance Sheet and Income Statement before its IPO from moneycontrol site.
